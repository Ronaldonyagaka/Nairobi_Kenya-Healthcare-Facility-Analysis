# Nairobi Kenya Healthcare Facility Analysis

This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of healthcare accessibility and demographic disparities in Nairobi, Kenya. The study has been meticulously carried out by Ronald Ongori Nyagaka and Florence Nguuni with the overarching goal of evaluating the distribution and capacity of healthcare facilities in relation to the population's needs.

## Problem Statement

Despite Kenya's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, there are significant challenges in achieving universal health coverage. This analysis aims to identify gaps and opportunities for targeted improvements in healthcare services across Nairobi's socio-demographic landscape.

## Objectives

- **Assessment of Healthcare Facility Distribution**: Evaluate the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities in Nairobi and their accessibility across different demographics.
- **Demographic and Health Profile Analysis**: Analyze the demographic data from the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census for Nairobi.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between the location of healthcare facilities and demographic factors.
