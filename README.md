# Nairobi Kenya Healthcare Facility Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains an analytical study focusing on healthcare accessibility and demographic disparities within Nairobi, Kenya. Conducted by Ronald Ongori Nyagaka and Florence Nguuni, the project aims to illuminate the state of healthcare facilities in Nairobi, offering insights into how they meet the population's needs.

## Problem Statement
Kenya's journey towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 is fraught with disparities in healthcare accessibility, demographic health variances, and systemic limitations. This project provides an analytical foundation to address these challenges.

## Objectives
- **Evaluate Healthcare Facility Distribution**: To assess the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities across Nairobi and determine their accessibility for various demographic groups.
- **Analyze Demographic and Health Profiles**: To interpret demographic data with the aim of understanding population dynamics and their implications for healthcare demand.
- **Investigate Correlation Between Demographics and Facility Locations**: To explore how healthcare facility locations correlate with demographic factors such as population density, age distribution, and socioeconomic status.

## Detailed Sections

### Setup and Initialization
In the initial setup phase, we import libraries essential for data analysis such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`. The environment is prepared with necessary configurations to support the rendering of plots and manipulation of dataframes.

### Preliminary Data Analysis
The preliminary analysis involves examining the datasets to understand the structure, content, and initial patterns. This phase sets the stage for deeper analysis and helps in identifying potential areas of focus.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Here, we tackle challenges in the data such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. We also perform transformations on the dataset to make it suitable for our specific analytical needs, such as normalizing text and adjusting data types.

### Hypothesis Formulation and Analysis
We formulate several hypotheses relating to healthcare accessibility and resource allocation. Utilizing statistical tests, we either affirm or refute these hypotheses based on our dataset, paving the way for informed conclusions and recommendations.

### Insights, Conclusion, and Recommendations
This section presents the distilled insights from our analysis, summing up the findings and suggesting concrete recommendations for policymakers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders.
